                <h2>Isnos Huila History</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The municipality of Isnos is located in the southwestern part of Colombia and the Department of Huila, 228 km from Neiva, occupying 1.81% of the department's area.</li>
                    <li>Isnos can be considered an important center of volcanic activity.</li>
                    <li>The water system of the municipality is made up by
                        A wide network, the most important being the Magdalena, Bordones and Mazamorras rivers and the streams that supply the different aqueducts such as Helechuzal, Banderas, Gallineros, La Negra and Guadualito.</li>
                    <li>The behavior of the municipal economy by sector reflects the prevalence of the agricultural and livestock sectors, but without real signs of agroindustrialization processes, since it is fundamentally artisanal (trapiche, hornilla).</li>
                    <li>Another dynamic sector is the tertiary sector, which stands out for the important role played by the commercial and transportation sector, which markets between 1,000 and 1,200 tons of panela per month, in different presentations (4 pounds, pulverized, kilo, pound, tablet and panelin).).</li>
                </ul>
